Structured Outputs
Introduction
JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied JSON Schema, so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structed Outputs include:

Reliable type-safety: No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
Explicit refusals: Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
Simpler prompting: No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting
In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for Python and JavaScript also make it easy to define object schemas using Pydantic and Zod respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response
node.js

import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    { role: "user", content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday." },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
});

const event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
Supported models
Structured Outputs are available in our latest large language models, starting with GPT-4o:

gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 and later
gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and later
Older models like gpt-4-turbo and earlier may use JSON mode instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via response_format


Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

When using function calling
When using a json_schema response format
Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via response_format are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured response_format
The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Chat Completions API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the Function Calling guide.
Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.

STRUCTURED OUTPUTS	JSON MODE
Outputs valid JSON	Yes	Yes
Adheres to schema	Yes (see supported schemas)	No
Compatible models	gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later	gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models
Enabling	response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }	response_format: { type: "json_object" }
Examples
Chain of thought
You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring
node.js

import OpenAI from "openai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed;
Example response
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "Start with the equation 8x + 7 = -23.",
      "output": "8x + 7 = -23"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable.",
      "output": "8x = -23 - 7"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the right side of the equation.",
      "output": "8x = -30"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Divide both sides by 8 to solve for x.",
      "output": "x = -30 / 8"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the fraction.",
      "output": "x = -15 / 4"
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "x = -15 / 4"
}
How to use Structured Outputs with response_format


You can use Structured Outputs with the new SDK helper to parse the model's output into your desired format, or you can specify the JSON schema directly.
